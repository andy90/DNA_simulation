The setting of the base pair bindind simulation is taken from Stofer et al (JACS 1999). The parameters of the base pairs are from amber99bsc1 (Amber99 force field Parmbsc1 for DNA (Ivani et al. Nature methods, 13(1), pp.55-58.)). This force field does not have force field parameters for isolated base pairs. So I have to replace the sugar by a coarse grained methane atom following the instruction in Stofer et al (JACS 1999). 

The parameters of the Calcium or Magnesium ion are also taken from amber99bsc1.

The bond length between Phosphate and Oxygen, and the LJ parameters of the two ions, are taken from amber99bsc1.
The charge of Phosphate and Oxygen is taken from Demichellis et al (JPCb 2018).
